# React Native Project : Little Lemon

The goal of this project is to create a mobile application that utilizes SQLite as a local database, fetches data from an API, and provides various features for filtering and searching the data. Additionally, the application will include a boarding screen to enhance the user experience.

Key features of the project:

1.  SQLite Integration: The application will integrate SQLite, a lightweight and embedded database, to store and retrieve data locally on the user's device. This allows for efficient data management and offline access.

2.  API Data Fetching: The application will fetch data from an external API, enabling the retrieval of real-time or pre-defined data. The fetched data will be stored in the SQLite database for further use.

3.  Filter Buttons: The user interface will include filter buttons that allow users to refine the displayed data based on specific criteria. When a filter button is selected, the application will query the SQLite database and fetch only the relevant data to update the displayed content.

4.  Search Bar: The application will feature a search bar that enables users to search for specific items within the fetched data. As the user types in the search bar, the application will dynamically filter the displayed data based on the entered search query.

5.  Boarding Screen: To enhance the user experience, a boarding screen will be implemented. The boarding screen will provide an introduction to the application's features, offer a brief tutorial or tips on how to use the app effectively, and potentially showcase some key functionality.
